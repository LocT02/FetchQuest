// Gameplay
Explore the world and get pets from the NPCs by walking up to them! Get those scores in :)
NPCs will give you more points when you give them items! This game is meant to be a relaxing game,
as such there really are no objectives other than exploring and having fun! There are quests you can complete, 
but no real indicators for those quests yet. Currently you can turn everyone into zombies, play pool, get the janitor fired, 
pull the fire alarm, and eat all the flying fish and each quest should work in multiplayer as well (besides the fish one)!
Otherwise, your goal is to get the highest score you can by doing these quests and receiving pets by walking up to AI.
You can also give them any item for extra points!

// Goals for this Demo:
We wanted to add as much interaction to the game as possible as well as make the environment physics based.
We also wanted to add special AI interactions that allow the player to affect the world in some permanent way. 
Currently the very basics of the game are running well especially in single player. However, many of the key
features such as the physics based objects are not synced well in multiplayer. We are going to spend most of our remaining
time fixing bugs with the quests, AI, and multiplayer. We plan to add a few quality of life features such as some form of
notification on objects that players are allowed to interact with as well as one final quest line. The biggest problems
we have with the current state of the game are all related ensuring players know what they can and can't do. Such as deciphering 
between useable and non-useable objects. Recognizing that there are problems to be solved and incentivizing them to do so, such as
getting players to play pool or have a reason to get passed the locked doors. The final problem we have is that players
have no clear incentives to play together in multiplayer since there are no explicit goals for them to accomplish. 


// Some Known Bugs:
Movement can get stuck halfway through some vents.
AI tend to destroy their own area.
Some objects fall through the world at high speeds or after being dropped.
Game cannot be restarted after playing a multiplayer game. (the application must be closed entirely and restarted).
